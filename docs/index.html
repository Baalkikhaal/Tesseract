<h1>Tesseract - A project on optical character recognition</h1>
<p>This page documents the Tesseract project.
<a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract</a> is library that provides optical character recognition functionality using neural networks.
We use <a href="https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract">PyTesseract</a>, a Python wrapper for Tesseract library to access the library's routines.
The library was tested on scanned PDF copy of the famous book <b>Weaving the Web</b>. 
Since tesseract library takes in png images as input, I need to first the convert the PDF pages into png.
<b>Poppler</b> is a linux library that handles pdf to png conversion.
However to use Poppler in window, one needs Windows Subsystem for Linux.
The details of installing and using Poppler in Windows are found in the <a href="https://github.com/Baalkikhaal/Tesseract#install-popper-utils">README of the project</a>.
I wrote a small Python script "pdftopng.py" to convert pdf to png.
And another small Python script "pngtotxt.py" that processes a png image to text
To have a look at the source code and example Python script check the <a href= "https://github.com/Baalkikhaal/Tesseract">Tesseract repository</a>
